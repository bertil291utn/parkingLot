The application is still in development, developed in Ionic but is only available for android devices and online. It was written to help drivers find the nearest available parking space according to their position. 

## Live Demo

As it's just for Cayambe county in Ecuador to test you have to set your **geolocation** position phone (fake geolocation app) or browser near here `lat: 0.04065, long: -78.142787` and then you could see all available parking.
